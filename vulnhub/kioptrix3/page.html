I started dirb and started looking at some pages<br/>
<img src="image.png"/><br/>
Notice the URL here<br/>
<img src="image 2.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried using page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../etc/passwd but that didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
I also tried page=../../../../etc/passwd%00 and page=/etc/passwd but they didn't work either.<br/>
<br/>
After viewing the source, I noticed that lotusCMS was being.<br/>
Also, I looked at gallary page and after viewing source code, i found a link to the admin page which was commented out.<br/>
On the admin page I saw link to gallarific, the software being used.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
After doing some reason, I discovered that lotusCSM has a vuln and found an exploit too.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the exploit https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/122161/LotusCMS-3.0-PHP-Code-Execution.html<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This machine is running Ubuntu 8.04 with kernel 2.6.24. I tried vmsplice exploit but it didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
Also there is a usernamed loneferret which has couple of files in their directory.<br/>
<img src="image 5.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I did the following<br/>
<img src="image 6.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I'm stuck. I looked at a walkthrough for a hint and started looking at webapp again.<br/>
<br/>
I see this<br/>
<img src="image 7.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I used the mysql information to get more passwords<br/>
<img src="image 8.png"/><br/>
<br/>
First hash is for Mast3r and second is for starwars<br/>
<br/>
I was able to use dreg's password to ssh into their account. I was also able to use loneferrets password to log into their account.<br/>
<br/>
I executed the ht file:<br/>
<img src="image 9.png"/><br/>
<br/>
it's ht version 2.0.18 there is an exploit for it but I wasn't able to run it due to the target having an older version of perl.<br/>
<br/>
Since I can run ht as root, I can open up files. I looked into /root and got this:<br/>
<img src="image 10.png"/><br/>
<br/>
But that's not a shell so it doesn't count.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the password file and searched for the root password hash and of course I saw walkthroughs popup in the results. I noticed sudoers in the results and that kinda gave away what I needed to do.<br/>
I edited the sudoers file to look like this:<br/>
<img src="image 11.png"/><br/>
<br/>
and I was finally able to get root.<br/>
<br/>
There were multiple ways to get shell access to the VM. Check out this blog post https://volta-sec.blogspot.com/2017/02/kioptrix-level-3-dont-forget-low.html<br/>
