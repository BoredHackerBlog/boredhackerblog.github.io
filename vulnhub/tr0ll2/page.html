I ran dirb on all the URL's which were returned from robots file and got nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at a walkthrough for a hint. I have to examine the images from 4 of the folders that I can access.<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the images and ran strings on them. One of them had this: Look Deep within y0ur_self for the answer<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 3.png"/><br/>
<br/>
The file contained bunch of base64 data. I used sort and uniq to make a new clean file since some data was repeated. I decoded the base64 data as well.<br/>
<br/>
I thought just like last time, maybe answer.txt is the password and contents, decoded to ascii, are usernames so I tried brute forcing ssh. It didn't help. <br/>
I started brute forcing SSH again but this time with base64 data. I also started brute forcing ftp with decoded data. None of that worked.<br/>
<br/>
Another hint was needed. I needed to log into the ftp server with Tr0ll as the username and password.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 4.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 5.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 6.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess the answer.txt file was for this.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 7.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 8.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I assumed that noob maybe a username so I tried this:<br/>
<img src="image 9.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I tried scp too and it didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at a walkthrough again for help. Turns out you can use shellshock and get a shell like this:<br/>
ssh -i noob noob@10.0.0.149 '() { :;}; /bin/bash'<br/>
<br/>
I ran this: find / -user root -perm -4000<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Consolas"/></span></div>-print<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Consolas"/></span></div>2&gt;/dev/null <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I ran one of the binaries and I could no longer use ls...Pretty sure I broke everything because I ran all 3 of the binaries.<br/>
This is one way to get file names<br/>
<img src="image 11.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I used this exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839/ and got root, kinda. passwd was messed up and firefart was set to id 0.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are other ways to root the box. One of the files under door directory was vulnerable to buffer overflow.<br/>
