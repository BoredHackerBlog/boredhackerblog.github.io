I didn't see any interesting vuln for the services. I didn't make any progress against webapp.<br/>
<br/>
Time for a hint from one of the walkthroughs. PUT is enabled. nikto usually prints that I think but when I scanned the URL, it didn't. Maybe I scanned it incorrectly. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This worked:<br/>
curl -i -X PUT -H &quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8&quot; --data-binary &quot;@simple-backdoor.php&quot; http://10.0.0.35/test/backdoor.php<br/>

The system is Ubuntu 12.04 with 3.11.0-15-generic kernel<br/>
<br/>
Reverse shells that I put on the box didn't connect back. I had to check someone's walkthrough to see if i was on the right path or not.<br/>
<br/>
So for my reverse shells, I used the port 80, 8000, and 53. Someone else used 443. I tested with 443 and it worked.<br/>
<br/>
This has been very useful: python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;)' OR python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;)' I found it here: https://netsec.ws/?p=337 and I've probably seen it on other sites too.<br/>
<br/>
I found an exploit for 3.11.0 but it was for 64-bit systems. <br/>
<br/>
I looked at a walkthrough for hint and chkrootkit mentioned. There is an exploit for it https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33899/<br/>
<br/>
I placed a python reverse shell as /tmp/update and disconnected my current session and started listening on 443 again for root shell this time!<br/>
cron job ran and reverse shell got executed!<br/>
