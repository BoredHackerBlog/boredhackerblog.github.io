After some googling and some help from walkthrough, this was discovered: <br/>

File upload:<br/>
<img src="image 10.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uploading simple-backdoor.php is not allowed. Changing the extension to .php.jpg or .php.png. Got error 002.<br/>
<br/>
I used LFI again to access upload.php file.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
OWASP has info on file uploads:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload<br/>
<br/>
notice getimagesize()<br/>
<br/>
This was used to make a gif<br/>

<br/>
Of course the file has to be executed as php in order to be able to do anything. This is where I had to use some help by looking at a walkthrough. I forgot to download index file...<br/>
<br/>
index file has an unimplimented feature which looks at the cookie value lang and includes a file.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 13.png"/><br/>
<br/>
For some reason, sending GET request with lang parameter correctly, it still didn't work. I kept getting 500 response. After some googling, i figured out that I can use GIF89; then php code on the next line so I modified simple-backdoor.php file and uploaded that.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No errors this time:<br/>

<br/>
Running as www-data as expected:<br/>

<br/>
Netcat exists on the system<br/>
<img src="image 17.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I got netcat listening<br/>
<img src="image 18.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I got pty shell using python, as you can see there are four users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 19.png"/><br/>
<br/>
We have passwords for some of the users from the sql database.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to log into kent and kane account. Kent had an empty folder. Kane has a setuid executable file.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 20.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Running strings on the file shows this:<br/>
<img src="image 21.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can modify PATH and get the application to execute your &quot;cat&quot; file/script.<br/>

<br/>
Mike has another file:<br/>
<img src="image 23.png"/><br/>
<br/>
running strings on it shows this:<br/>
<img src="image 24.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Knowing that our input goes to %s, we can inject command and execute a shell<br/>

<br/>
^ that didn't help. I was still not root.<br/>
<br/>

I needed -p after bash...<br/>

<br/>
That was more difficult than it should've been. Mostly because the amount of small mistakes I've made and the times I didn't pay enough attention.</body></html>
