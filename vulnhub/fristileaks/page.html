I changed my attacker machine and now it's behind NAT. Also, this machine has vmware tools installed.<br/>

Going to locations defined in robots.txt gives this as result:<br/>
<img src="image 3.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I had to use a walkthrough to figure out that I need to go to /fristi. I guess I should have picked up on that after looking at robots.txt. <br/>
<br/>
/fristi looks like this:<br/>
<img src="image 4.png"/><br/>
<br/>
There is a message in the source code:<br/>
<img src="image 5.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Also there is base64 data as comment.Converting the base64 data results in an image file with this:<br/>
<img src="image 6.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I can guess that eezeepz is a username but I didn't guess that the text in the image was the password but it was...<br/>
<br/>
logging in takes me here:<br/>
<img src="image 7.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I can't upload .php file but I can upload .gif file so I did upload one and got this as a result:<br/>
<img src="image 8.png"/><br/>
I can access the gif<br/>
<img src="image 9.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I uploaded simple-backdoor.php.gif without modifying contents of simple-backdoor.php and I was able to access that as well.<br/>
<img src="image 10.png"/><br/>
<br/>
After looking in /bin and and /usr/bin, I didn't see netcat or nc. I did see wget and curl. oh and python is also installed.<br/>
<br/>
I found some python shells here: https://github.com/infodox/python-pty-shells<br/>
<br/>
I used tcp reverse and got a shell. (earlier i did say that im using nat and I am. I had it connect back to another machine)<br/>
<br/>
When doing ps and netstat, i noticed that mysql was running. I checked the webserver files to see if it contained info about mysql and it did.<br/>
<img src="image 11.png"/><br/>
<br/>
This is what the database had:<br/>
<img src="image 12.png"/><br/>
<br/>
uname -a shows the following:<br/>
Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-573.8.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Nov 10 18:01:38 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux<br/>
<br/>
I looked for exploits for 2.6.32 centos and found this: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25444/<br/>
The system also has GCC on it. I downloaded, compiled, and executed the code and it didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
I initially looked at the home folder and passwd but I went back and examined it again. I was able to access /home/eezeepz.<br/>
<br/>
It has an interesting file:<br/>
<img src="image 13.png"/><br/>
<br/>
The notes.txt contains this:<br/>
Yo EZ,<br/>
<br/>
I made it possible for you to do some automated checks,<br/>
but I did only allow you access to /usr/bin/* system binaries. I did<br/>
however copy a few extra often needed commands to my<br/>
homedir: chmod, df, cat, echo, ps, grep, egrep so you can use those<br/>
from /home/admin/<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to specify the full path for each binary!<br/>
<br/>
Just put a file called &quot;runthis&quot; in /tmp/, each line one command. The<br/>
output goes to the file &quot;cronresult&quot; in /tmp/. It should<br/>
run every minute with my account privileges.<br/>

I started out by doing this:<br/>
<img src="image 14.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 15.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I shoulda paid close attention to the note...<br/>
<br/>
I echoed /usr/bin/whoami to the file and it ran. It was running as admin.<br/>
<br/>
Now to get admin shell, I can have the cron job run python reverse shell. I modifed the port on the old python script I uploaded and uploaded the updated one and got shell.<br/>
<img src="image 16.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Here are the files I see in the admin folder:<br/>
<img src="image 17.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I examined the files that I thought were interesting:<br/>
<img src="image 18.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Encoding basically takes arg as input then turns it into base64 and reverses it, before applying rot13 operation.<br/>
<br/>
I decoded the passwords using python:<br/>
<img src="image 19.png"/><br/>
<br/>
The first password gets me access to fristigod account.<br/>
second password is for the admin account.<br/>
<br/>
I moved into the home folder for fristigod account and discovered a hidden dir with a binary<br/>
<img src="image 20.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I used the following to disassemble the binary:<br/>
objdump -d -M intel doCom<br/>
<br/>
In the main function I see this:<br/>
<img src="image 21.png"/><br/>
<br/>
getuid returns uid in eax, which gets moved to rbp-0x4 and then compared with 0x1f7, which is 503. UID 503 is for fristi user.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I examined sudo -l output and I was able to run the binary as fristi user and get shell.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="image 23.png"/><br/>
<br/>
This one was fun.I didn't make too many mistakes and I didn't have to look at other walkthroughs as much as I did for pwnlab init.<br/>
